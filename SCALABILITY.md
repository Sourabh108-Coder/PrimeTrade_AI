# Scalability Notes

- Frontend and backend are decoupled for independent scaling
- JWT-based authentication allows stateless backend scaling
- MongoDB can be migrated to managed services like Atlas
- APIs are modular and can be split into microservices
- Frontend can be deployed on CDN-backed platforms (Vercel/Netlify)
- Backend can scale horizontally using load balancers
